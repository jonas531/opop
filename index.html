                 As an economics student, I am keenly interested in understanding the relationship between the economy and the development of different countries. Therefore, I would like to enroll in financial or economics courses at the university to deepen my knowledge in this area. Additionally, during my preparation for the Macau 12th Geography Olympiad, I developed a fascination for geography and its relation to economics, which has further strengthened my resolve to study economics in university. I recognize that factors such as climate, environment, culture, latitude, and time zones significantly influence the economy in a given area, which is why I am also considering geography as my second choice of study at the university.</p>
<p class="article__content">
By pursuing a degree in economics, I will gain a comprehensive understanding of macroeconomics and microeconomics, including topics such as economic growth, inflation, monetary policy, and international trade. Moreover, I will learn statistical analysis and mathematical modeling, two essential skills in the field of economics.</p>
           
        
<p class="article__content">
On the other hand, studying geography will afford me the opportunity to explore the physical and human aspects of the world, such as climate, landforms, natural resources, culture, and population distribution. The field of geography is vast and can be divided into different sub-fields, including physical geography, human geography, and environmental geography. </p>

            <p class="article__content">
In conclusion, I believe that studying economics and geography will provide me with a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between people, the environment, and the economy. These fields are essential in comprehending the complex factors that influence the development of different countries.</p>
